# Arduino
The given arduino codes are a part of a competetion that me and my team was a part of namely : Gadget-o-mania by INSEES 
Our project was to design a smart systems for agriculture. Our idea was to integrate a PIR sensor with arduino that would set off a buzzer when the sensor detected human movements at times when there should be no movement..
Besides this we also conceptualised a DHT sensor integrating with arduino and deploying our ML model to predict what crops would best suit a soil.
